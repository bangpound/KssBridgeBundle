    <p>The blocks above were created with a simple template call:</p>
    <pre><code>{% raw %}{% for childSection in sections %}
    {% include 'ScanKssBundle:Blocks:block.html.twig' with
        {
            'section' : childSection
        }
    %}
{% endfor %}{% endraw %}</code></pre>

    <p>
      Take a look at the source code to this Symfony2 Bundle for more details. The goal
      is to remove the pain from creating a styleguide â€” document your CSS, have
      example HTML in your templates and automate as much as possible.
